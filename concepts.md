For example, if a $100 stock has a history of spiking 10% with each earnings release,Â 
The earning release events increases the volatility
 
We might have the following scenarios based on the earning event
$90 - current - $110

Writer
Scenario: Stocks drops
	Write a call option: CDD-MM-XXXX108
	The market price at expiration/evaluation stays below Strike price
	The premium is earned

Scenario: Stocks rises
	Write a put option: PDD-MM-XXXX91
	The market price at expiration/evaluation stays above Strike price
	The premium is earned

Buyer
Scenario: Stocks rises
	Buy a call option: CDD-MM-XXXX108
	The market price at expiration/evaluation rises above Strike price
	The profit (Mp-Sk) - P

Scenario: Stocks drops
	Buy a put option: PDD-MM-XXXX108
	The market price at expiration/evaluation drops below Strike price
	The profit (Sk - Mp) - P 

Writer

Scenario: Stock drops:
    * Write a call option: CDD-MM-XXXX108
    * If the market price at expiration/evaluation stays below the strike price ($108 in this case), the writer keeps the premium earned from selling the call option.
    * This strategy is profitable for the writer if the stock price remains below the strike price because the 


Scenario: Stock rises:
    * Write a put option: PDD-MM-XXXX91
    * If the market price at expiration/evaluation stays above the strike price ($91 in this case), the writer keeps the premium earned from selling the put option.
    * This strategy is profitable for the writer if the stock price remains above the strike price because the put option will expire worthless.

Buyer:
Scenario: Stock rises:
    * Buy a call option: CDD-MM-XXXX108
    * If the market price at expiration/evaluation rises above the strike price ($108 in this case), the buyer profits from the difference between the market price and the strike price, minus the premium paid for the option.
    * This strategy is profitable for the buyer if the stock price exceeds the strike price by more than the premium paid for the call option.


Scenario: Stock drops:
    * Buy a put option: PDD-MM-XXXX108
    * If the market price at expiration/evaluation drops below the strike price ($108 in this case), the buyer profits from the difference between the strike price and the market price, minus the premium paid for the option.
    * This strategy is profitable for the buyer if the stock price falls below the strike price by more than the premium paid for the put option.

**Topic: Data Required for Training an Option Trading Model**

**1. Data Needed to Train an Option Trading Model:**

Building an options trading model requires a diverse set of data beyond the standard OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data used for the underlying asset. Here's a comprehensive list of the data you should consider gathering to train your option trading model:

**1. OHLC Data for the Underlying Asset**:
   - Open, High, Low, Close prices
   - Volume traded
   - Any other relevant data, such as dividends, splits, and corporate actions

**2. Option Chain Data**:
   - **Option Prices**: For various strike prices and expiration dates.
   - **Greeks**: Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho.
   - **Implied Volatility**: Historical and current implied volatility for various options.
   - **Volume and Open Interest**: To understand the liquidity and interest in particular options.
   - **Bid-Ask Spread**: For each option.
   - **Historical Option Chain**: Gather historical option chain data for backtesting.
   - **Option Expiration Dates**: Including weekly, monthly, quarterly, LEAPS, etc.
   - **Option Chain Changes**: How the option chain evolves over time.

**3. Volatility Data**:
   - **Historical Volatility**: Volatility of the underlying asset over time.
   - **Implied Volatility**: Derived from option prices.
   - **Volatility Skew**: The implied volatility disparity between different strike prices and expiration dates.

**4. Interest Rates**:
   - **Risk-Free Interest Rate**: Often, the 10-year Treasury note yield is used as a proxy.
   - **Dividend Yield**: If the underlying asset pays dividends.

**5. Market Data**:
   - **S&P 500 or Other Market Indices**: To determine the overall market trend.
   - **VIX (CBOE Volatility Index)**: Measures the market's expectation of volatility implied by S&P 500 index options.
   - **Market Sentiment Data**: News sentiment, investor sentiment, etc.

**6. Economic Indicators**:
   - **Employment Data**: Unemployment rate, non-farm payrolls, etc.
   - **Inflation Data**: CPI, PPI, etc.
   - **Interest Rate Decisions**: Fed announcements, etc.
   - **GDP Data**: Economic growth indicators.

**7. Company-Specific Data**:
   - **Earnings Dates and Estimates**: Expected earnings, actual earnings, surprises, etc.
   - **Fundamental Data**: P/E ratio, earnings per share, etc.
   - **Corporate Actions**: Mergers, acquisitions, product launches, etc.

**8. News and Sentiment Data**:
   - **Financial News Feeds**: Gather sentiment analysis from financial news sources.
   - **Social Media Sentiment**: Twitter, StockTwits, etc.

**9. Machine Learning Features**:
   - **Technical Indicators**: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.
   - **Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis**: Using NLP models to analyze news sentiment.

**10. Other Factors**:
    - **Weather Data**: If the underlying asset is influenced by weather (e.g., commodities).
    - **Geopolitical Events**: Major political or global events that can influence the market.

After gathering this data, your next steps would involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and then training your options trading model. Remember, the effectiveness of your model will heavily rely on the quality and relevance of the data you gather.

**2. Gathering Option Chain Data:**

**Option Chain Data**:

This is an example of option chain data for the past week. You would need to collect similar data for different expiration

 dates and times within the past week to have a comprehensive dataset for training your options trading model.

**3. Filtering In the Money (ITM) Options:**

When collecting option chain data for training your option trading model, you should include both call and put options, each with various strike prices and expiration dates, along with their corresponding bid and ask prices. Here's a revised example of option chain data for the past week, considering both call and put options:

### Example Option Chain Data for the Past Week:

```plaintext

```

This table includes both call and put options, each with various strike prices and expiration dates, along with their corresponding bid and ask prices. You would need to collect similar data for different expiration dates and times within the past week to have a comprehensive dataset for training your options trading model.

**4. Filtering In the Money (ITM) Options:**

You're correct; not all options are profitable. Filtering out options that are out of the money (OTM) is a common strategy to focus on more relevant data. Training your model with only the most relevant data can save computational resources and can also make your model more effective. Here's how you can filter your option chain data to focus on in the money (ITM) options before training your model:

### Filtering for In the Money (ITM) Options:

1. **Identify In the Money (ITM) Options**:
   - ITM call options have strike prices below the current market price of the underlying asset.
   - ITM put options have strike prices above the current market price of the underlying asset.

2. **Filtering Criteria**:
   - Filter out options that are significantly out of the money (OTM), typically using a certain percentage threshold. For example, you may consider options with a delta above 0.5 or 0.6 to be ITM.

3. **Training Data Preparation**:
   - After filtering, use the remaining ITM options data to train your option trading model.

### Example Python Code to Filter In the Money (ITM) Options:

```python
def filter_itm_options(option_chain_data):
    """
    Filter in the money (ITM) options from the option chain data.

    Parameters:
    option_chain_data (DataFrame): Option chain data.

    Returns:
    DataFrame: ITM option chain data.
    """
    # Calculate the current market price
    current_market_price = option_chain_data[option_chain_data['Option Type'] == 'Call']['Underlying Price'].iloc[0]

    # Calculate the delta for call options
    option_chain_data['Delta'] = np.where(option_chain_data['Option Type'] == 'Call',
                                          option_chain_data['Delta'],
                                          -1 * option_chain_data['Delta'])

    # Filter in the money options (delta > 0.5)
    itm_options = option_chain_data[option_chain_data['Delta'] > 0.5]

    return itm_options

# Example usage:
# Filter ITM options from the option chain data
itm_option_chain_data = filter_itm_options(option_chain_data)
```

By applying the above filter, you can reduce the size of your dataset and improve the relevancy of the data you feed into your model. This will not only save computational resources but will also help your model focus on the most relevant information for making profitable trading decisions.
